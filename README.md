We got about halfway through creating the neural net. Next week we shall establish stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation, which are the fundamental 'learning' tools of a neural network.

If you would like further reading on the structure of this neural network we recommend the book by Michael Nielsen, http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html. This is our guide throughout this term.
