The code completed in week 16's workshop

You can run this on your local machine but we recommend Kaggle so that you can use their efficient GPUs and you can access the dataset really simply. If you do attempt this locally, download the data from above and import it seperately. If you have issues with this, drop Matt or Charlie a message and they should be able to help you.

We got about halfway through creating the neural net. Next week we shall establish stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation, which are the fundamental 'learning' tools of a neural network.

If you would like further reading on the structure of this neural network we recommend the book by Michael Nielsen, http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html. This is our guide throughout this term and we are using his MNIST neural network as a guide to how these work.
